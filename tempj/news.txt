(AAN), a leader in the sales and lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential furniture, consumer electronics, home appliances and accessories, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association to repurchase $125 million of the Company's common stock under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. The Company will use cash on hand to fund the ASR program. The Company is scheduled to pay $125 million to Wells Fargo on December 4, 2013, in exchange for approximately 3.5 million shares, currently estimated to represent 80% of the total number of shares expected to be purchased in the program, based on current market prices and assuming the program ends as scheduled. The total number of shares that Aaron's ultimately purchases, however, will be determined based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average share price of its common stock over the duration of the program, less an agreed-upon discount, and is subject to certain adjustments under the agreement. As of October 25, 2013, Aaron's had approximately 76.3 million shares of common stock outstanding.","pubDate":"1386158400000","type":"news","symbol":"AAN","market":"NYSE"}},

At the time, the company cautioned that such an idea was a ways away, that Google wanted to target Windows desktops first. But it seems that Chrome apps could arrive on Android and iOS sooner than we thought.. Google has figured out a way to port apps to mobile using a new set of tools, and it hopes to release a beta version of those tools as soon as next month. As reported by The Next Web, Google has been working on a compatibility layer for Chrome apps using the open source Apache Cordova tools. Where Chrome apps can do fancy things with your computer's GPU and other local hardware using Chrome-specific code, Google can allow them to do the same with mobile devices by using Cordova plugins that replicate and replace the equivalent Chrome app APIs.","pubDate":"1386128798000","type":"news","symbol":"APA","market":"NYSE"}},

The announcement comes after Reuters cited a source familiar with the deal as saying Bank of Ireland would raise between 500 and 600 million euros of new equity as early as this week and would repay the rest through issuing debt. The deal also follows a steady stream of more positive economic news in Ireland, including the fastest fall in unemployment in four years, that convinced Dublin to make a clean break from its bailout programme.","pubDate":"1386150181000","type":"news","symbol":"CS","market":"NYSE"}},

The discovery well, located in Mississippi Canyon 782, was drilled to a total depth of 19,234 feet in 6,580 feet of water. Dantzler is located 12 miles west of the Company's Rio Grande development area, which includes discoveries at Big Bend and Troubadour. Discovered gross resources(1) at Dantzler are now estimated at between 55 and 95 million barrels of oil equivalent. The Tamar SW well, testing a new exploration prospect, encountered approximately 355 feet of net natural gas pay within the targeted Miocene intervals. Tamar SW, which was drilled to a total depth of 17,420 feet in 5,405 feet of water, is the Company's eighth consecutive discovery in the Levant Basin. The field is located approximately 8 miles southwest of the Tamar field. Evaluation of drilling data and wireline logs has confirmed the range(1) of gross resources of the field to be between 640 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas and 770 Bcf. The well encountered high-quality reservoir sands, with per well productivity anticipated to be approximately 250 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.","pubDate":"1386161940000","type":"news","symbol":"NBL","market":"NYSE"}},

(\"Violin\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: VMEM) and certain of its officers and directors. The complaint alleges that the Company's Registration Statement and Prospectus for its initial public offering (\"IPO\") were materially untrue when issued. According to Violin, the IPO raised proceeds of $162 million. The underwriters of the IPO, who are also named as Defendants, include: J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Barclays, among others. The complaint alleges that the Company failed to disclose that, prior to the IPO, Violin's sales and revenues had been materially impacted by the reprioritization of federal agencies' budgets due to the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations over the federal budget and the possibility of a shutdown of the federal government. This news came to light on November 21, 2013, less than two months after its IPO, when the Company shocked the market by disclosing that Violin's third quarter net loss widened to $34.1 million, nearly twice the amount analysts expected and that its fourth quarter revenues would be $30 million to $32 million, which drastically trailed the average analyst estimate of $43 million. On this disclosure, the Company's share price plummeted, falling from $6.00 per share on November 21, 2013 to close at $3.11 per share on November 22, 2013.","pubDate":"1386150300000","type":"news","symbol":"VMEM","market":"NYSE"}},
